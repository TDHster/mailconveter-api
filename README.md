# Project Description: API Server and Test Form for File Conversion

This project serves as an API server and includes a test form designed for file conversion. The server receives files through the HTTP POST method, utilizes a converter (via Wine), and responds with the converted file. The accompanying test form facilitates comprehensive testing of the entire cycle, resembling the functionality like of Swagger.

## Features:
- **File Conversion:** The API server supports file conversion using a converter integrated with Wine.
- **HTTP POST Method:** File submissions are handled through the HTTP POST method, providing a straightforward and standardized way to upload files.
- **Test Form:** A user-friendly test form is included for convenient and comprehensive testing of the entire file conversion cycle.

## Usage:
1. **File Submission:** Send files to the API server using the HTTP POST method.
2. **Conversion Process:** The server initiates the file conversion process using the integrated converter (not included in project).
3. **Response:** Receive the converted file as a response from the API server.

## Test Form:
- **Swagger-Like Interface:** The test form provides an intuitive and Swagger-like interface but more user friendly design for testing the API functionalities.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Test various scenarios, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the file conversion process.
- **Custom Web Form Design:** The form's design is tailored to meet the specific requirements of the project, offering a unique and user-friendly experience.

## Project Origin:
This project was initiated in response to a custom request for a web form designed for testing purposes. The API server and accompanying test form provide a seamless and efficient solution for file conversion testing.

Feel free to explore and contribute to this project as it evolves to meet additional requirements and enhancements.
